# Asanyukta Mudras Kathak Detection Model

Welcome to the **Kathak Mudra Detection Model** repository, where tradition meets technology. This project is designed for both Kathak enthusiasts and developers interested in the intersection of classical dance and computer vision.

## Overview

Kathak, a classical dance form from India, relies heavily on precise hand gestures known as *Asamyukta Hasta Mudras*. These single-hand gestures are vital in conveying emotions and storytelling within the dance. However, mastering these intricate gestures can be challenging, especially for students and practitioners without constant access to expert guidance.

This repository hosts a powerful model trained using YOLOv8, specifically designed to detect and analyze these mudras in real-time. Our model is built on a fully customized dataset, ensuring it meets the unique requirements of Kathak hand gesture recognition.
